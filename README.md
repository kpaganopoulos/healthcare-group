Group assignment: Documenting a health challenge using analytics
Point of view

Imagine a government or a healthcare provider has asked you to shed light on a health-related issue using your analytical skills and your understanding of the challenges posed by health-related data that you have developed throughout this module.

You can choose the focus of your analysis as long as you have found a reasonably rich health related data to demonstrate your skills. You can also combine multiple sources of data.

The marking grid below will give you an idea of the format and content of your report.

Format of the Report

The written report should be a maximum of 6 pages excluding appendices and references (5-12 pages expected length of extra material). There should be at least one main table or graph in your report to support your analysis; the rest of the tables and graphs can be added to the appendices.

The fonts are Book Antiqua or Times New Roman. Font size in the text must be 12. A larger font (14) can be used for headings. Line spacing must be 1.5 and Harvard referencing must be used.

Content and Marking (out of 20 points)

You will be marked on the relevance of your research question, the quality of data that you have found to support your analysis, but most importantly how you use it, the quality of the data presentation, what your interpretation of your analysis is, and the discussion of the results.

Introduction – Provide some background information and context (3/20)
• E.g. countries’ situation, economic development
• Medical history of the health outcomes of interest
• Any relevant context specific information, existing evidence.

Descriptive statistics (6/20)

• Just to give you a benchmark, I am expecting an analysis relying on about 10-20 "control" variables and about 2 health measures (i.e. having only one health related outcome as a dependant variable is fine, but I don’t recommend you have more than three, which is already a lot). Remember, the control variables are typically individual characteristics, socio-economic information, etc. explain your selection, how the variables are measured, what dimension(s) they capture
• Choose appropriate graphs (static vs dynamic, pie, etc) to present your data
• Produce maps only if appropriate.

Regressions (6/20): describe how health measures are associated with your other variables

• Present some simple regressions using the appropriate models depending on your outcome(s) of choice
• Exploit the data to produce a meaningful conclusion. For example, consider panel data methods, predictions, different levels of analysis (country, region, individual, male vs female).

Discuss your limitations (2/20)

Appendix (3/20)

• Explain your choice of dataset(s) and if you have used other datasets but did not use them in the end, explain it here (1/20)
• Quality of the appendix, relevance of the information provided, referencing, code (2/20) - yes, you need to submit your code with your report, either as a separate document, or as extra pages in your appendix.

Make sure:

• To clearly state your objectives
• To correctly label your graphs, titles, data and axis
• To have tables that contain enough information to interpret the results
• To cite sources and report your references
• To provide the code you have written to extract, clean and interpret the data.

Here are some options to find data:

NHS Digital

You can look for your own data and discuss it with me. Keep in mind the evaluation scale and make sure you can do the analyse for the all the aspects that will be marked. See at the end for extra data sources and suggestions.

MIMIC III

MIMIC – III comprises over 58,000 hospital admissions for 38,645 adults and 7,875 neonates. The data spans June 2001 - October 2012. The database, although deidentified, still contains detailed information regarding the clinical care of patients, so must be treated with appropriate care and respect.
This is a very interesting dataset.
